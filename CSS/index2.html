            <p>A bull market is a market that is on the rise and where the conditions of the
                economy are generally favorable.</p>
            <p>A bear market exists in an economy that is receding and where most stocks are
                declining in value.</p>

            <h1>Characteristics of Bull and Bear Markets</h1>
            <p>Although a bull market or a bear market condition is marked by the
                direction of stock prices, there are some accompanying characteristics that
                investors should be aware of.</p>
            <h2>Supply and Demand for Securities-</h2>
            <p>In a bull market, there is strong demand and weak supply for securities. In
                other words, many investors wish to buy securities but few are willing to
                sell them. As a result, share prices will rise as investors compete to obtain
                available equity. </p>
            <div class="image">

            </div>
            <p>In a bear market, the opposite is true: more people are looking to sell than
                buy. The demand is significantly lower than supply and, as a result, share
                prices drop.</p>
            <h2>Investor Psychology-</h2>
            <p>Because the market's behavior is impacted and determined by how
                individuals perceive and react to its behavior, investor psychology and
                sentiment affect whether the market will rise or fall. Stock market
                performance and investor psychology are mutually dependent. In a bull
                market, investors willingly participate in the hope of obtaining a profit. </p>

            <h2>Change in Economic Activity-</h2>
            <p>Because the businesses whose stocks are trading on the exchanges
                are participants in the greater economy, the stock market and the
                economy are strongly linked. </p>
            <div class="image">

            </div>
            <p>A bear market is associated with a weak economy. Most businesses are
                unable to record huge profits because consumers are not spending nearly
                enough. This decline in profits directly affects the way the market
                values stocks.</p>
