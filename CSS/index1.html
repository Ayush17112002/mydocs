            <p>NSE or National Stock Exchange was founded in 1992 and is comparatively the youngest stock exchange in
                India. But, it got its recognition as a stock exchange only in 1993. They pioneered the trading industry
                by introducing fully automated, electronic, and screen-based trading in India. They have provided a
                secure platform for trading shares and bonds, electronically, since 1995.The electronic trading system
                helped remove the paper-based settlement system from trading.</p>

            <p>Although there are only a few differences between NSE and BSE, we have to be very sure of which one to
                choose, especially if you are new to investing. If you are a beginner and new to this field, it is
                always better to invest in BSE, whereas NSE is for seasoned investors. In case you are looking for a new
                company to invest in then, BSE is the best option. On the other hand, if you are a day trader or likes
                to take risks then NSE is more suitable for you.

            <p>The answer to this question is very simple, yes you can buy stocks from BSE and sell them in NSE as long
                as you have a DEMAT account.Â  But the question that arises here is that why would someone do it? In
                order to buy from BSE and sell in NSE involves a lot of risk factors. Everyone would choose security
                over risks.</p>
